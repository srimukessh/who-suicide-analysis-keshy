# WHO Suicide Data Analysis using Python


Statistics about suicide are not easy to collate, and may be inaccurate due to the sensitivity of the issue. However,taking into account the existing data I am going to present the analysis on world suicide data from 1985 to 2016. The following features are present in the dataset:

- country-name of the countries
- year-year for the suicides recorded
- sex-gender
- age-age groups
- suicides_no-number of suicides for the mentioned age groupes
- population-number of individuals in the corresponding age groups
- HDI for year-The Human Development Index for given year (a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators)
- gdp_for_year - GDP (a monetary measure of all market values of all the goods and services produced in certain period of time)

In this project, I will be taking you through the whole process of cleaning, analysing and visualzing important takeaways from this dataset.
