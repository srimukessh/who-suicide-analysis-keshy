# who-suicide-analysis-keshy


Statistics about suicide are not easy to collate, and may be inaccurate due to the sensitivity of the issue. However,taking into account the existing data I am going to present the analysis on world suicide data from 1985 to 2016. The following features are present in the dataset:

1. country-name of the countries
2. year-year for the suicides recorded
3. sex-gender
4. age-age groups
5. suicides_no-number of suicides for the mentioned age groupes
6. population-number of individuals in the corresponding age groups
7. HDI for year-The Human Development Index for given year (a statistic composite index of life expectancy, education, and per capita income indicators)
8. gdp_for_year - GDP (a monetary measure of all market values of all the goods and services produced in certain period of time)

In this project, I will be taking you through the whole process of cleaning, analysing and visualzing important takeaways from this dataset.
